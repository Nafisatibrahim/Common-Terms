            <h2>AI</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. It encompasses various methods, including rule-based systems, machine learning, and deep learning, to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.</p>

        <section id="data-science">
            <h2>Data Science</h2>
            <p>Data Science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge and insights from data. It combines statistics, mathematics, programming, and domain expertise to analyze, interpret, and visualize data. Data scientists use various tools and techniques to transform raw data into meaningful information that can drive decision-making and predictions.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="machine-learning">
            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can detect patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes based on historical data. Machine learning is widely used in applications such as recommendation systems, spam filtering, and image recognition.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="deep-learning">
            <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
            <p>Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized branch of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with many layers (hence the term "deep") to analyze complex patterns in large amounts of data. Deep learning algorithms are particularly effective in tasks such as image and speech recognition, language translation, and autonomous driving.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="neural-networks">
            <h2>Neural Networks</h2>
            <p>Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected "neurons" that process input data to recognize patterns and make predictions. Neural networks are a foundational component of deep learning and are widely used in tasks like image classification, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.</p>
